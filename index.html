    <h1> Ngā Whetū e Iwa o Matariki<br>
        The Nine Stars of Matariki</h1>
        <p>Matariki is a star cluster that appears in the early morning sky in New Zealand during the mid-winter months. The star cluster is well known throughout the world and can be seen around the globe at different times of the year. It is one of the brightest clusters in the sky, containing hundreds of member stars, nine distinguishable to the naked eye. Matariki has different names around the world. In English, it is often called by its ancient Greek name, the Pleiades or the Seven Sisters (the nine stars also include the sisters’ parents, Atlas and Pleione). In Hawaiian it is Makali’i, ‘eyes of royalty’, and in Japan it is Subaru, meaning ‘gathered together’. The name Matariki seems to be derived from ‘ngā mata o te ariki o Tāwhirimātea’, the eyes of the weather god Tāwhirimatea.<br>

            The reappearance of the Matariki star cluster during mid-winter signals the beginning of the Māori New Year. Traditionally, Matariki festivities included lighting ritual fires, making offerings and various celebrations to farewell the dead, honour ancestors and celebrate life. Nowadays, people all across Aotearoa come together to remember their ancestors, share kai (food), sing waiata (songs), tell stories and play music. Matariki is about reconnecting with your home and whānau (family). Some iwi (tribes) are unable to see Matariki from their rohe (region), and herald the new year with another star named Puanga (Rigel). Each of the whētu (stars) in the cluster is intrinsically connected, and they’re individually named and defined with a purpose.
